## Presentation

### Why this app?

I made this app while learning D3.js. But while I had in mind that my goal was to use it in an Ionic app, I realized there was some differences compared to a classical use. Mainly because of Typescript.

If you're in this case, you need to install TypeScript type definitions. So syntax may be different than a simple usage of D3.js.


### Who is this for?

I propose to share my work to make you save time while learning.

I think these examples could also be appropriated if you already are in and advanced step of your learning but stuck on some points.


### What can you find here?

Most of these examples are based on [Dashing D3.js tutorials](https://www.dashingd3js.com/table-of-contents) adapted in Typescript 2 for Ionic 3. 


### Context


#### What is Ionic

I suppose if you're here you know what Ionic is, probably your favorite framework for building amazing mobile apps :-)

This is not exactly our subject here but if you are an Ionic developer I suggest you to make the [documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/) your bible.

#### What is D3.js

D3 (or D3.js) is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML.

[Learn more about D3.js here](https://d3js.org/). Consider it as a complementary of your bible if you wanna learn data visualization.

### Still don't understand anything?

I suggest you to be more familiar with the context. 

Otherwise you're maybe not a developer and I'm sorry you're here :-)


## Installation

Install the app by running:
```
npm install -g ionic cordova
npm i
ionic cordova prepare
```

Run the app: 
```
ionic serve -l
```
or on a device: 
```
