    <h1 no-margin margin-bottom>D3.js with Ionic</h1>



    <h2>Presentation</h2>

    <h3>Why this app?</h3>
    <div padding-horizontal>
        <p>I made this app while learning D3.js. But while I had in mind that my goal was to use it in an Ionic app, I realized there was some differences compared to a classical use. Mainly because of Typescript.</p>
        <p>If you're in this case, you need to install TypeScript type definitions. So syntax may be different than a simple usage of D3.js.
    </div>


    <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
    <div padding-horizontal>
        <p>I propose to share my work to make you save time while learning.</p>
        <p>I think these examples could also be appropriated if you already are in and advanced step of your learning but stuck on some points.</p>
    </div>


    <h3>What can you find here?</h3>
    <div padding-horizontal>
        <p>Most of these examples are based on <a href="https://www.dashingd3js.com/table-of-contents" target="_blank">Dashing D3.js tutorials</a> adapted in Typescript 2 for Ionic 3. </p>
        <p>Source code is available <a href="https://github.com/proustibat/d3js-ionic" target="_blank">on this github repo</a>.</p>

    <h2>Context</h2>

    <h3>What is Ionic</h3>
    <div padding-horizontal>
        <p>I suppose if you're here you know what Ionic is, probably your favorite framework for building amazing mobile apps :-)</p>
        <p>This is not exactly our subject here but if you are an Ionic developer I suggest you to make the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/" target="_blank">documentation</a> your bible.</p>
    </div>


    <h3>What is D3.js</h3>
    <div padding-horizontal>
        <p>D3 (or D3.js) is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML</p>
        <p><a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">Learn more about D3.js here</a>. Consider it as a complementary of your bible if you wanna learn data visualization.</p>
    </div>


    <h3>Still don't understand anything?</h3>
    <div padding-horizontal>
        <p>I suggest you to be more familiar with the context.</p>
        <p>Otherwise you're maybe not a developer and I'm sorry you're here :-)</p>
